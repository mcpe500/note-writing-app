# Flutter Writing App Prototype

This is a Flutter prototype for a mobile writing app, allowing users to create and edit text content on their devices. It serves as the final project for my Basic Flutter Certification obtained through Dicoding. While it includes a login page, note that user authentication is not implemented in this prototype. This is intended as a mockup/prototype to showcase the core writing functionality.
